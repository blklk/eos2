This is my second code for calculating and plotting EOS.
The code convieniently shows and saves both plots.
Most importantly, the EOS fit is given with uncertainties listed in the run view (using PyCharm).

This EOS fit has been cross checked with more advanced softwares that calculate EOS.


To get started you with the code, you will need *.xlsx files. 
You should utilize the sheets in each *.xlsx
